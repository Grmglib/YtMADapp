# YtMAD:Youtube Movie and Audio Downloader
**YtMAD** is an application that lets you download videos and audios from video and playlist URL.
Using keywords is also supported, making search videos by title and channel possible.
> **Note**:
> This application uses [**YoutubeExplode**](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/YoutubeExplode) to interact with YouTube.
> Use of YoutubeExplode is based on my YtMAD API project, functioning as an isolated back-end.
